# hello-world
Initial welcome and establishing a presence
I am and have been involved with IT for quite some time, plunking along. Career changes have changed my directions a few times but I have kept my hand in the IT world by creating a Linux network at home, with to racks of HP Servers to PRIVATELY test/install/configure/explore/discard programs of interest to me and that support my other interests.
Currently, I am exploring laser engraving (2 x Chinese 5040 types), hobby CNC (Stepcraft 840 CNC System with Asprie+UCCNC) as well as invesitgating an inventory program that I would be able to eventually use to track sales of products I have crafted at home.
It's a lot of work!
